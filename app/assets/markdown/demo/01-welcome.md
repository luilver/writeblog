# Welcome to Writeblog

Thanks for downloading Writeblog. 

Writeblog is remarkably simple software that allows you to publish text and pictures in a simple, browsable online blog format. It's independent publishing for everyone.

Use it for everything from an instruction manual (like this one!), to employee handbooks, internal technical runbooks, graphic novels, collections of short stories, poetry, blog posts, novels, or family history. Put it all into Writeblog and instantly publish to the web.

And because you host it yourself, you own all your own data. With no limits on readers or writers, you can create as many blogs as you like. You're in control.

In the pages that follow we'll help you get started with Writeblog and show you how it all works. 

We can't wait to see what you make with it!

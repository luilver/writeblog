# Publishing your blog

Writeblog can be used to publish private blogs just for your team, or public
blogs available for everyone on the web.

## Private blogs
Private blogs are available to anyone who is signed in to your Writeblog and
has permission to read a blog. See the section, [Users, Readers &
Writers](/2/the-writeblog-manual/29/users-readers-writers) for details.

## Publishing to the web
To make a blog available to everyone on the internet, just flip the switch from
locked to web. Your blog will be instantly available at the URL displayed when
the switch is on. There are tools below to display a QR code or copy the URL so
you can share it in an email, text, or chatâ€”or link to it on your home page.

## Public URLs
Your blog's public URL consists of the domain you provided when you set up
Writeblog plus a _slug_ derived from the title of the blog. For example, if
your Writeblog is at `blogs.37signals.com`, then the title _Getting Real_ will
be published at `blogs.37signals.com/getting-real`. You can change this slug if
you don't like the one Writeblog provided.

### Redirecting
Visitors who visit your URL without any blog slug (.e.g.,
`blogs.37signals.com`) will be redirected to your published blog. If you have
more than one blog published to the web, they'll see a list of all public blogs
on your Writeblog that are published. If you don't have any published blogs,
they'll be directed to sign in.

# Writing

We've designed Writeblog to be an calm, enjoyable and distraction-free place to
write.

Here's what you need to know.

## Editing mode

The first step when working on your blog is to flip the switch and enter
_Editing mode_. That will reveal the page toolbar and save button. Edit mode
stays on even as you move around to other pages in your blog while working. You
can turn it off when you're done working or toggle it anytime to preview your
changes as readers will see them.

## Autosave

Writeblog automatically saves as you write so you don't have to think about
saving or worry about losing your work. The _Save_ button in the page toolbar
continually comminicates where the are unsaved changes, when it's in the
process of saving, and when all changes have been saved. You can hit the button
if you want to, but it'll save for you even if you don't.

## Full Screen

For more immersive, distraction-free writing hit the expand button at the top
of the screen to enter fullscreen mode (on supported devices). [Full
Screen](/2/the-writeblog-manual/170/reading#fullscreen) hides most of the
clutter and busyness of your device and operating system so you can focus on
your work. _Hint: you can use Full Screen while reading, too!_

## Version history

As you work on your blog, Writeblog will track when you've made a batch of
changes and record them as a new version. Hit the _History_ button next to the
_Save_ button to browse through previous versions of any page.
